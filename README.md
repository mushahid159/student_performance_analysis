# Student Performance Data Analysis

# Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of student performance data using Python. The project leverages various data science techniques to gain insights into factors affecting student performance and build predictive models.

# Project Highlights


# Data Cleaning & Preparation:
```Ensures data quality and consistency by handling missing values and converting data types.```
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
```Visualizes distributions and trends to understand the underlying patterns in the data.```
# Categorical & Correlation Analysis:
```Examines the impact of categorical factors on GPA and identifies relationships between numerical variables.```
# Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
```Reduces dimensionality to simplify data visualization and highlight key features.```
# Linear Regression Modeling:
```Builds a predictive model to estimate GPA based on student attributes.```
# Files Included
```Student_performance_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the complete analysis, including data cleaning, visualization, and modeling.```
Student_performance_data_.csv:
```Dataset used for analysis.```
# Installation
